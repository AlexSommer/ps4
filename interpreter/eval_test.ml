In terms of testing problem 3, multiple TA's told us it was much more important to test
extensively the functionality in the top level, and therefore we dedicated the time that
we would have used to write unit tests to testing everything we could think of in the top
level. So while we don't have unit tests, we tested extensively, and TA's told us that this 
was OK.
