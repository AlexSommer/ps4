Hi! 
  Though we struggled with some of the ambiguity in the problem set, my partner and
I found problem 3 very rewarding, and problems 1 and 2 definitely gave us a better 
understanding of some of the more straightforward course material.
   In terms of dividing up work, we found for this problem set, because the work is primarily 
all done on the same file and the complexity of problem 3,  it was better to do the driver/spotter 
method of programming on a single computer to ensure we were no the same page,and  this worked 
relatively well for us. However it was much slower than being able to work on two 
computers at once. 
  The TA's were very helpful, and office hours were very effective in helping us complete 
 this project.
